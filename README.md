# Urban Trivia
## How well do you know your world?

Inspired by a <a href="https://twitter.com/manur/status/739288698936659968">Washington Post feature</a> on recognizing cities by their street grids alone, we expanded the feature to cover more cities around the world.

And because no two people share the same set of experiences, we made this further extensible by allowing you to design your own quizzes.

Share and enjoy.
